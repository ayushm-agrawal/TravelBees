--Coding Conventions
We will follow certain naming conventions throughout the project so that it is clean and it is easier for everyone to understand. 

1.) All the variable declaration will be done in "CAMELCASE". For example - "String fooBar;"
2.) All the ids given to UI elements will use "SNAKE CASE". For Example - "btn_create_trip" . This specifies that it is a create trip button.
3.) All the activities in the java folder will start with the name "Activity". For example - "ActivitySplashScreen". 
4.) All the fragments in the java folder will start with the name "Fragment". For example - "FragmentFooBar".
5.) All the interfaces in the java folder will start with the name "Interface". For example - "InterfaceFooBar".
6.) Strings in xml files will "Not Be Hardcoded". All the string values will be stores in the strings folder. We will use "SNAKE CASE" for this.
7.) We will write self explanatory code which will reduce the amount of comments that we have to use in a single class.


--Commenting Conventions
We will follow certain commenting conventions which will make it easier to make changes to the activities.

1.) All the java classes will have a block after declaring the package which will follow the particular format.
